                <br />
                <br />
                I first came to Canada in 2015 to pursue a degree in electrical engineering at
                McGill University. During this time, I discovered a passion for computer science and
                machine learning, opting to pursue them both with my final year of technical
                elective courses. After receiving my B. Eng. In Electrical Engineering, I was
                privileged to start a position as a software engineer at a local Montreal startup,
                Stocate. There, I continued to develop my full-stack web development skills,
                learning a wide range of technologies in a relatively short space of time out of
                necessity for the business. I delivered their entire mobile application and
                contributed heavily to their website and database construction. I quickly rose
                through the ranks at Stocate, briefly becoming interim CTO, before eventually
                leaving to pursue my master's degree.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my master's degree at McGill University, I conducted research for my lab's
                Non-Invasive Physical Activity Monitoring System (NiPAMS) project, focusing on the
                application and optimization of various machine learning models to predict human
                vital sign information from vibrational cardiography data. I led the machine
                learning component of the NiPAMS team, producing models that predicted vital sign
                information such as blood pressure, respiration rate, respiration phase, respiration
                volume, etc., with accuracies averaging around 92.5%. This work led to multiple
                published academic papers and ultimately my thesis.
                <br />
                <br />
                I completed my M. Sc. in June of this year (2023), and have since been working as a
                part-time AI/ML consultant while I spend my free time building various coding
                projects (such as this very website!) and applying to full-time software engineering
                positions.
